It's not exactly a straight forward answer, a lot of factors come into play here. Making a career change is a huge decision. But first, let me back up, and give a little background on me. 

I was a lost soul, like many others, not knowing what I wanted to do when I grow up, as a "career". I was always good at math, and science; not so good at history or english though. So I figured I would go into a math/science type of field eventually. College, however, is a very mysterious place. I took a course on Sociology as a pre-req, and it blew my mind. I loved it! I had never even heard of Sociology before that class! Long story short, I majored in Sociology. Now, was that the best decision I could have made? No. But in the end, it brought me to Flatiron, so it all worked out. 

After graduating, I got a job in customer service at a small company. It was a great job, all things considered. But, after 2 years there, I knew I had to make a change, since I did not want this to be my career. I did research on various career paths, a lot required more schooling. I wasn't opposed to more schooling, but I didn't want to go back for 2 years. In the end, it was my mom who introduced me to Software Engineering. She actually worked as a programmer for about 10 years back in the day. At her current company, she heard about some new people getting hired who were fresh out of a software "bootcamp" type of course. She asked around, and got the scoop for me. It all sounded really cool, and I was definitley interested. I did my research, and decided to try Flatirons free bootcamp prep. I didn't finish it, but I didn't really intend to. I just wanted to get a feel for it, to see if this would be something I would want to pursue. Since I'm here writing this blog, it's pretty obvious that I decided to pursue this path. Although I'm still in the beginning stages of learning, I'm excited to see where it will take me. It's frustrating as hell, but once it works, you feel like a rockstar. 

It doesn't matter your path, everyones path is different. All that matters is that we are here now, and eager to learn.
