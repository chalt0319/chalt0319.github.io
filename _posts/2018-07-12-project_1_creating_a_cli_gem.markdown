I'm not going to lie, this project was very frustrating for me. 

Being that this was the first project, there were bound to be some hiccups. Staring the project was one of them. Creating a gem proved much more difficult than it seemed. The first issue I ran into was setting up my Learn IDE that was not in browser. Learning how that worked, and how to push things to GitHub took more time than I would like to admit. For some reason, I was having an extremely hard time pushing things up to GitHub. I looked at my notes, and was doing everything correctly, but it just wasn't working. The only way I could get it to work, was to first make a repo on Github, and then clone that into my terminal, and then create the gem, and then push it back to GitHub. Writing this out, makes me realize that that's really the only way that makes sense. For some reason, I was trying to create the folders/files in the Learn IDE environment first, and then push that to GitHub. But that doesn't make sense now that I think about it. 

The next issue I ran into was getting my `require_relative` and `require` to work properly. It took a lot of googling, and videos to finally see what I was doing wrong. Finally, once I actually had something that I could run, with out any errors, it was time to start coding. I starting with some basic tests with `puts` to make sure it was doing what it was supposed to. Once that was all good, I started with my first Class.

The first Class I made was the Pokemon class. This is where I put my methods that the user would interact with. It started with a greeting, and then listed the Pokemon. Then it prompted the user to enter in a number for the Pokemon they would like to learn about. At first, I just hard coded all the data to make sure my class and methods were working. Once I had everything working like I wanted it to, I made a Scraper class. In this Scraper class is where I retrieved data from websites to fill in my code. This is what took the longest for me. I had a very hard time scraping the data. Scraping is no joke. It's very complicated, and hard to narrow down on the information that you want. Eventually, after literally hours, I got it how I wanted it. 

This project was the first time that we had to create something from beginning to end, with no tests. It was very daunting. I struggled through it a lot. It was good though, because we are eventually going to be creating things from scratch ourselves, and we need all the practice we can get if we want to be successful.
