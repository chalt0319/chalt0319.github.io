I definitley liked this project a lot more than my first one. I understood this one more, which made it easier for me. It probably also helped that I am more experienced than I was when I was doing my first project. 

Coming up with an idea for the website was a little challenging, since the example websites we did were so perfect, it was hard to think of another example. Once I did think of something, I went straight to work. I like to make one route at a time, and make sure that one works how I want it to, then move on to another one. That way I know which one isn't working, and can fix it. This works pretty well at first, but when you want to go back and make it more complex, or add more elements, that's when it can get a little tricky. Luckily, `pry` exists, which makes finding the problem a LOT easier. I used `pry` a lot in this project so I could see what the params were at that moment in time, or to see what the issue was. Most of the time jumping into pry made me realize what the issue was. When I couldn't figure it out, I usually went online to see if I could find something to help me fix it. 

One thing that I still don't know why it wasn't working, was the flash messages. For whatever reason, They would work on some of the post routes, but not others. I made sure they were the same format, but it just wasn't doing what I wanted it to. This was one of the times I went online to see if I was doing something wrong. I ended up learning a new way to show messages with the session hash. It was very similar, but a little different. This worked for me, so luckily I was able to get the website working like I wanted it to. 

I really enjoyed this project, I liked working with Sinatra, it makes sense to me.
