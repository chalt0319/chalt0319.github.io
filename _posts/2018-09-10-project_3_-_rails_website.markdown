Rails, Rails, Rails. Unlike Sinatra, Rails has a lot of things that make your life WAY easier. It was hard to get used to it at first, but once you do, your world really opens up.

The routes stand out to me the most. With Sinatra, you had to make all your routes yourself. With Rails, it lets you write a whole bunch of code with one little word: `resources`. This little word, and the one that follows, does so much. Granted, you have to understand how everything works to use it. For example, you have to know the RESTful routes it creates, and how to access them. I would sometimes use the `rake routes` trick if I was getting confused, especially when I was learning nested routes. But after a while, I didn't need to look at the routes, because they follow a pattern, so you can guess the route for all of them. 

There is a lot of "magic" in rails. It just, *knows*, which view to render. Without you having to do anything! Thats pretty cool. As long as you understand how to set up everything, and name all the files correctly, it shouldn't take you long to get a basic application working. Especially if you use any of the rails generators. That's another thing that's very magical. You can simply type in `rails g resource User` and BOOM, a bunch of files are created and filled in with basic info. Pretty sweet. 

In regards to my project, I had a lot of fun creating it. I chose to create a Cruise site, where you can choose a ship, and then book excursions to go on at different ports. I recently went on a cruise, so I used a lot of the seed information from my own cruise to get started. As with any project, things change and evolve the further you get into it. You have to be able to adapt to what makes the most sense when you actually start building the website. 

One thing I really loved using was `raise params.inspect` when I was trying to figure out certain links, and routes. It really lets you know what is, and what is not, passed to the next page. And from there, you can figure out a differnet way to achieve your goal, or google around to see if there is a solution to your issue. I definitely had to google how to do things during this project. But that's what being a programmer is. Being able to solve your own problems, by learning new ways to do things. There are a lot of things posted online from other people asking about their own code issues, and you can learn from their mistakes to make your code better. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this project. Creating something from scratch, and knowing that all the functionality you see on your website, you made yourself, is a great feeling.
