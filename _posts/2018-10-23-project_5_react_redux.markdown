I’m not sure if it’s because this is the final project, or because I understood this subject better, but I really enjoyed making this project.

It started off a little shaky, but once I got going everything went very well. Based on how my last project went, which was a little challenging for me, I was assuming this one would be even more challenging. Surprisingly, I didn’t really run into any issues I couldn't figure out. 

I started out just getting the basic set up, where the gif’s would run down the middle like Instagram. Then I slowly added CSS to get it looking the way I wanted, then I added more functionality. The first thing I added was a like button, so that when someone liked a post, they could see all of their liked posts. I had to add a route at that point so the user could actually go and see all their liked posts. That was the first issue I can into. I had to google around a little to remember how to set up the links without reloading the page. Once I had that down, I had to make a navigation bar at the top. I chose to make them all images instead of words to make it look better. I had a home button, a like button, and a comment button. The “like” button would take you to all your liked posts, and the “comment” button would take you to all the posts you commented on. 

The comment section was a little more difficult than the like section, because I had to make each comment it’s own object in the state in order to store them. Then I had to make sure to store the posts Id with that comment so that I could display the correct comments on the correct posts. All of which wasn’t that difficult. 

I’m not sure what it was about this project, but everything just, clicked. I had the basic website up in a couple hours, and just added on from there. I really struggled at the beginning of this section, it just made no sense to me. However, once it clicked, it clicked. I understood how passing props worked, how the store worked, how to access the store, etc. One of the more fun parts of this project was actually the CSS, and making it look nice.
